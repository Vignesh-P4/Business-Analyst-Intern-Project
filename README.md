🍔 Food Delivery Analytics Project – Business Analyst Internship
This project was completed during my Business Analyst Internship at ThinkMates, an EdTech startup based in T-Hub, Hyderabad, Telangana. The goal was to optimize food delivery operations by analyzing structured transaction data and building insights-driven dashboards for business stakeholders.

📌 Project Summary
In the fast-paced world of food delivery, businesses often struggle with delays, inefficiencies, and a lack of real-time decision-making tools. This project aimed to bridge that gap using data analytics.
By combining Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python, I extracted actionable insights from structured food delivery data to understand patterns in preparation time, order value, customer feedback, and more.
